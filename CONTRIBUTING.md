# Contributing
Before contributing to this project, please read the guideline below.
## Branches
This repository is divided in two main branches:

* main
* develop

`main` contains the official release. This branch should allways pass the tests and compilations. You should *never* commit or merge to this branch directly. Only pull requests from `develop` branch or hotfix branches are allowed to this branch.

`develop` is the branch from which feature branches are originated. This branch should be treated with the same care as main branch. Commits to this branch should be done by pull requesting feature branches. Only when a new feature is ready and tested, `develop` branch can be combined with the `main` branch.
