Before contributing to this project, please read the guideline below. \hypertarget{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Branches}\label{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md1}
This repository is divided in two main branches\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item main
\item develop
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily main} contains the official release. This branch should allways pass the tests and compilations. You should {\itshape never} commit or merge to this branch directly. Only pull requests from {\ttfamily develop} branch or hotfix branches are allowed to this branch.

{\ttfamily develop} is the branch from which feature branches are originated. This branch should be treated with the same care as main branch. Commits to this branch should be done by pull requesting feature branches. Only when a new feature is ready and tested, {\ttfamily develop} branch can be combined with the {\ttfamily main} branch.\hypertarget{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{Naming conventions}\label{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md2}
Follow these branch naming conventions to keep the branches organize.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily u/username/description} All feature branches should have the name of the user creating them and a description of the feature. For example, user {\ttfamily ckometter} is making a contribution to this markdown under the branch {\ttfamily u/ckometter/contributing}.
\item {\ttfamily XX-\/description} If there is an issue open for that feature, add the issue number {\ttfamily XX} on front for easy identification.
\item {\ttfamily hotfix-\/description} When creating a hotfix branch, add {\ttfamily hotfix} on front and label the pull request as a hotfix.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Workflow}\label{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md3}
We suggest the workflow below to ensure development runs smoothly without jeopardizing the main project.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Clone the project, switch to develop branch and create a new feature branch for your feature. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ git\ clone\ https://github.com/opendacs/od-\/dacadc.git}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ git\ fetch}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ git\ switch\ develop}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ git\ checkout\ -\/b\ [name\_of\_your\_branch]\ develop}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item Commit changes to your feature branch and push it. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ git\ add\ .}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ git\ commit\ -\/m\ '[your-\/commit-\/description]'}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ git\ push\ origin\ [name-\/of-\/your-\/branch]}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item When your feature branch is ready to merge to {\ttfamily develop}, create a pull request to review your contribution.
